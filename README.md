2048 Game

🎮 About the Game

The 2048 Game is a fun and addictive sliding puzzle game where you combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile. The game is played on a 4×4 grid, and players slide tiles in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one with double the value. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
